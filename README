1) In MySQL, create a database called "batchdb"
2) Type `use batchdb`
3) Run the script in `run.sql` under src\main\resources.
4) Seed the 30k records from the csv file into the table you want to process by running the command below:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\gs-batch-processing\\initial\\src\\main\\resources\\sample-data-2.csv"
INTO TABLE batchdb.input_user
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

5) Run the spring batch project by doing `.\gradlew bootRun`
6) See the results by checking the file name called `output-data.csv` in the root directory of project.
